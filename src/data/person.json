    "about": "My name is Lucas Bech, I'm 18 years old and a EUX data technician student at Syddansk Erhvervsskole in Odense, Denmark. Here I learn about servers, services, programming as well as other various useful tools for software development. At this time, I'm looking for an internship where I can put theory into practice and get real working experience. Naturally, I enjoy programming in my spare time - my other interests include science, philosophy and technology. I'm currently learning Vue.js and OpenGL."
